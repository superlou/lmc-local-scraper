Holiday Shopper's Passport:Kicking off on Small Business Saturday and lasting one week, participating businesses can list a promotion or offer on the printed passport. Participating locations can also be a distribution center for shoppers to get the passport and earn a sticker every time they make a purchase. When a shopper gets two stickers during the designated week, they turn in the card to the event sponsor and get rewarded with a prize. The kick-off on Nov. 29 will be supported by free trolley rides from noon - 4 pm thanks to the sponsorship of Anna & Jack's Treehouse. This event is open to ALL types of businesses and promotes shopping locally for great holiday gifts. Sign up online. If you don't have a brick-and-mortar location and want to discuss options, contact ginaproia@outlook.com. Holiday Dream Home Gingerbread Contest:Our nonprofit members will compete in a gingerbread house contest in hopes of winning one of three cash prizes. The nonprofit teams will be guided by a professional coach. Great opportunity for our service-based businesses to be part of the holiday events! Designers, architects, engineers, painters, contractors, etc... this one's for YOU! This new event is sponsored by Julie B. Fee Sotheby's and Chase! Sign up online. Holiday Stroll:Be part of this series of festive fun all through town where the community is invited to stroll, shop, sample treats and engage in holiday activities in business locations and outdoors in the business districts. Sponsors can choose to support the event overall and benefit from branding and promotion, without having to activate a Stroll activity, or you can sponsor a specific activity on the Stroll and have more direct connection with the community. This daytime event will be anchored by our returning horse-drawn carriages offering rides through town thanks to sponsorship by Houlihan Lawrence. This is a NEW activity and we are open to discussing ideas that suit your business if the below options don't fit. But, act fast. New ideas will only be considered in October. Contact Gina Proia, ginaproia@outlook.com to register for a Holiday Stroll activity.",2025-11-29 - 2025-12-06,Larchmont,,"adults, businesses, non-profits",Larchmont Chamber of Commerce
