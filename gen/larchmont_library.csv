In a remote village in Turkey, five orphaned sisters are denied their independence by their strict adult guardians after they are caught socializing with male classmates. Soon, they are locked in their home, deprived of communication with the outside world, and are schooled in domestic lessons while their custodians plan their arranged marriages. But the close-knit siblings rebel against these restrictions, and fight for a future in which they are free to make their own choices. Mustang is the feature-film debut of Deniz Gamze Erguven, and is France's official 2015 submission to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for Best Foreign Language Film.

In December 1972, Jean McConville, a thirty-eight-year-old mother of ten, was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders, her children clinging to her legs. They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.
