In a remote village in Turkey, five orphaned sisters are denied their independence by their strict adult guardians after they are caught socializing with male classmates. Soon, they are locked in their home, deprived of communication with the outside world, and are schooled in domestic lessons while their custodians plan their arranged marriages. But the close-knit siblings rebel against these restrictions, and fight for a future in which they are free to make their own choices. Mustang is the feature-film debut of Deniz Gamze Erguven, and is France's official 2015 submission to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for Best Foreign Language Film.
