0,Spooktacular Parade and Party,https://mamaroneckchamberofcommerce.org/events-calendar/spooktacular-parade-and-party,"Greetings Mamaroneck Avenue Businesses,

We are looking forward to supporting the **Village of Mamaroneck’s Annual Spooktacular Parade Sunday October 19, 2025 11am-2pm.**. There is no rain date.

In partnership with the Village of Mamaroneck, we want to inform you of the following:

* Authorities will close Mamaroneck Avenue and prohibit vehicle traffic from 10am-1pm on 10/19
* A large volume of toddler to school-aged children and their parents will gather at 448 Mamaroneck Avenue (Smashburger) by 11am and parade to Harbor Island
* Participants will then have a “Spooky” good time with candy distribution, haunted house, chamber sponsored games, and music hosted by volunteers and Chamber members starting around 12:15pm until 2pm at Harbor Island.

We encourage and invite you to get involved and here are some options:

1. **Donate candy in any amount** - feel free to label with your business and include coupons or promotional material to be distributed at Harbor Island. All donations can be dropped off to Pam at the Village of Mamaroneck Recreation Office or email us at info@mamaroneckchamberofcommerce.org to arrange for pick-up.
2. **Sponsor a game/activity** and have a representative host a table at Harbor Island. Please email us to confirm and we will share available games/activities and assign table placement. First come, first served!
3. **Offer volunteers!** We need all the help we can get for all activities at any time between 10am-3pm (set-up, parade/activities, breakdown/cleanup).

Thank you for your support! Please also post the included flier in your store window.
