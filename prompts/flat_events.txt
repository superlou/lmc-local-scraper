The current year is {year}, which should be assumed for dates if the year is not specified.
If event dates are not specified explicitly, use today's date, {today}, and the day of the week to estimate the date of the next occurrence.
For all Events, if there is enough information to estimate the target age for the Event, provide a list of one or more of the following: kids, teens, or adults.
Do not include events that have an unknown or unspecified time or location.
