In the following markdown description of a webpage, extract all events from {{start_date}} to {{finish_date}}.
For these events, identify their name, description, location, and when they occur.
Simplify the description to remove any formatting or newlines.
For these Events, specify dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.
The current year is {{start_date | date_year}}, which should be assumed for dates if the year is not specified.
For these Events, if there is enough information to estimate the target age for the Event, provide a list of one or more of the following: kids, teens, or adults.
Exclude events that have an unknown or unspecified time or location.

USE ONLY INFORMATION IN THE WEBPAGE.

If there are URLs that appear to be links to pages that may contain events, list those in 'event_urls'
*Do not include links that are NOT likely to contain more events in 'event_urls'.*
